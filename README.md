# DA401-PEQ-Project
My senior capstone project for DA401 that analyzes data from PACE Equity. 

Abstract: 
One of the hardest issues when combating climate change is finding the necessary balance between financial stability and green efficacy (Masson-Delmotte et al. 2021). One solution to this problem in the business world is PACE financing. PACE Financing enables property owners to obtain financing for energy efficiency, renewable energy, and water conservation projects, with repayment structured through property tax bills (Rose and Wei 2020). In this data analysis project, I delved into the financial landscape navigated by PACE Equity, a leading company in the PACE financing scene. The primary focus of the study is to identify the critical variables from a few that I was specifically asked to investigate by PACE Equity. The project also aims to cast a predictive lens towards untapped urban landscapes, identifying which cities hold the most potential for expansion opportunities that PACE Equity has yet to explore. These two goals make up the dual main research questions that I will be focusing on answering with this analysis. To determine what variables impact the total amount invested (TAF) the most I just did some simple regression analysis. This showed that the term of the loan was the best predictor of a profitable investment. And in order to predict what cities are the best targets for expansion I used a RandomForest model to predict the total investment in every city in the United States with a population greater than 10,000. I then looked at the top 10 cities with the highest predicted total amount invested, and determined that the 10 best cities to consider focusing on are Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Washington D.C., Atlanta, Miami, Phoenix, and Brooklyn.

This project will be mostly done in R-Studio.

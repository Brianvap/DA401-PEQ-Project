# DA401-PEQ-Project
My senior capstone project for DA401 that analyzes data from PACE Equity. 

I will be identifying what variables are the best predictors of Total Amount financed and what cities PACE Equity would likely have success in if they expanded. 

This project will be mostly done in R-Studio.

Data:
Data is aquired from PACE Equity and is located in the pace_data.csv
Data purchased from SimpleMaps and cannot be shared. Link here https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities

Code:
All Code is located in the DA401_Final.R File.
All the code can be ran if you have access to both datasets.

Final Report:
Final Writeups and the main report found in the PEQ_Project_Report.pdf
